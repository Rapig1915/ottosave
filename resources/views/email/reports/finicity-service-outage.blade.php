            <h3>Finicity Service Outage</h3>
            <p>
                Connection to the Finicity Service has been interrupted, all "Otto" subscribers are affected by this.
            </p>
            <p>
                This interruption may be due to a temporary downtime/maintenance window with Finicity itself or due to an error in internal Otto logic. The Otto system will re-attempt connection to the Finicity service every 15 minutes until a connection is re-established.
            </p>
